# UDRL Challenges

### Introduction

In this repository you will find the solution to the three challenges of the Udacity DRL Nanodegree:
- Navigation with Pixels.
- Crawler
- ![Soccer](DRL-Soccer).

### Getting Started

1. You first need to configure a Python 3.6 / PyTorch 0.4.0 environment with the needed requirements as described in the [Udacity repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies).
2. Of course you have to clone this project and have it accessible in your Python environment
3. Download the corresponding project environment. Instructions for downloading the environments are located in each project folder.   
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

4. Put the file in the corresponding project folder and unzip (or unzip) the file.

### Instructions

Each project has a Notebook with the instructions to Train and use an RL agent for each challenge.
